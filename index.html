						<h2>A Star's Life</h2>
					</header>
					<h3>The Universe</h3><p>To know about star life you probably want to know how the universe started. How the universe started was the big bang where there was a big explosion which made space a very high temperature and dense place. This big explosion made things called electrons, neutrons, and protons. Protons and neutrons formed together and now are called nuclei, however they aren't elements due to space being too hot for electrons not being able to join in. So about 380,000 years later, as it cooled down a lot, they finally made hydrogen and helium so now there is a bunch of gas in space that are getting closer together, very slowly, due to the gravitational pull making the first stars.</p>

						<h2>A Star's Life</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Star's life are up to their size as a big star will die only in about a couple hundred thousand years because of how much fuel the star consumes, but smaller stars consume their fuel much more slower, as our sun is one of the many smaller star's. Stars have 7 stages, named Giant gas cloud, Protostar, T-Tauri phase, main sequence, Red giant, fusion heavier of elements, and finally supernovae and Planetary nebulae. Giant gas cloud is when the star starts and the temperature is low enough to use synthesis. Protostar is when gas particles collide, producing heat and making the formation of warm accumulation of molecules that can be seen through infrared. T-Tauri phase is when solids collide into a protostar, releasing a lot of energy, this phase lasting about 100 million years.</p>

						<h2>Phases of a Star</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The main sequence phase is when the star reaches a temperature forcing hydrogen to transform helium, making the star's core so hot it releases, once again, a lot of energy. The Red Giant phase is when the star runs out of hydrogen to transform into helium, becoming a sub-giant then a red giant because of the cooler surface compared to the main sequence's surface. The fusion of heavier elements is when the fusion of helium ends causing fusion of carbon to commence repeating the process until iron forms in the core causing the core to collapse in the core turning into a white dwarf, if a small star like the sun. Supernovae and Planetary nebulae are when a star explodes and all the material flies off into space, but it converts into a neutron star also known as a black hole. However smaller stars will not explode as they turn into white as the solids will drift away slowly, but stars smaller than the sun will not burn anything as their mass is too small but the red glow from the main sequence, these stars can last for trillions of years</p>

						<h2>Death of a Star</h2>
						<p>When a star actually dies it becomes a nebula. There are five types of nebula that can form after a star's death including the Emission Nebula, Reflection Nebula, fairly Dark Nebula, Planetary Nebula and a Supernova Remnant. The closest nebula to planet earth f is 20 light years away or 117,572,507,463,680 miles away. there literally is an actual total estimate of 20,000 nebulas just in the milky way galaxy. It is predicted that in 5 billion years our own star, the sun, will die and generally become a nebula. There are lots of nebulas outside the Milky Way galaxy but we aren't advanced enough to really see that far into space but out there nebulas are called extra-galactic nebulae. There actually is a total estimate of 20,000 nebulas just in the Milky way galaxy. Black holes can also form when the nebula forms ether a average star or a massive star those specifically grow into generally bigger stars like the pretty red giant or the fairly red supergiant those turn into kind of other nebulas and supernovas and supernovas kind of have a chance to turn into a neutron star or a black hole. The closest nebula to planet earth is 20 light years away or 117,572,507,463,680 miles away.</p>
